## üìù Description

The only hint provided is a mathematical expression: (1/24) * (1/60) * (1/60)


This might suggest rarity or randomness, potentially referencing execution timing or behavior.

## üß© Solution

### 1. Download the Challenge File

We start by downloading the challenge binary using `wget`:

```bash
wget https://hubchallenges.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/reverse/pure-luck.out
```
2. Identify the File Type

Use the file command to inspect the binary: file pure-luck.out
 Output: pure-luck.out: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section header

This reveals it's a statically linked ELF executable, with no section headers ‚Äî often an indicator of packing or obfuscation.

3. Look for Strings in the Binary

We check for readable strings using the strings utility: strings -a pure-luck.out

Although the flag is not directly visible, an interesting string appears: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer

This suggests the binary is packed with UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables), a known tool used to compress and obfuscate binaries.

4. Unpack the Binary

To reverse engineer the actual logic, we must first unpack the binary using UPX: upx -d pure-luck.out -o unpacked.out
This will decompress the file and output an unpacked version named unpacked.out.

5. Reverse Engineer the Binary with Ghidra

  Once unpacked, we analyze the binary using Ghidra, a powerful reverse engineering framework developed by the NSA.

   Load unpacked.out into Ghidra.

  Navigate to the main function.

  You'll notice the flag is stored in an array of hexadecimal values.

  In the Listing view:

  Locate the relevant memory address.

  Right-click the data and select Data ‚Üí char to interpret the bytes as characters.

This reveals the hidden flag.
